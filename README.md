# Pytunnels

---

Pytunnels is a cli tool for connecting to remote server endpoints via ssh
tunnels based on the definitions provided in a more intuitive yaml config file.
It can connect through multiple bastion hosts and exposing multiple endpoints to
localhost ports you define.

Currently, it also supports URL and credentials lookups via Lastpass enabling
engineers to share connectivity schemes.
